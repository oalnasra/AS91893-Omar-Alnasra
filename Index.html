              Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding 
              to create both 2d and 3 dimensional objects 
              or figures. Origami is derived from two words Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).  
              The idea of Origami’s origin is linked to Zen and can be considered a form of meditation.

            <p>The name of Origami would only come about in 1880, coming from Orikata. At the time paper was considered a luxury only for the wealthy and high ranking in which it would become a important skill to master.  
              However, due to the production of cheap washi paper it would lead to Orikata to become the cultural phenomeon it is today in Japan. As the years went by the creation of the Origami we know today would come about by Akira Yoshizawa would develop the current standards for Origami diagrams and instructions publishing ”Origami Tokuhon” in 
              1957 which brought him great 
              attention and fame.</p>
